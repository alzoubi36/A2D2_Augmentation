## Bachelor Thesis: Generating Synthetic Combined Camera and LiDAR Data for 3D Object Detection

This repository contains the research work done in the bachelor's thesis of Mohammad Al Zoubi with the title "Generating Synthetic Combined Camera and LiDAR Data for 3D Object Detection". The thesis was supervised by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Christian HÃ¼hne and advised by Marco Brysch, Dr. Cay-Christian Kalmbach, and Christian Freystein at the Institute of Mechanics and Adaptronics at TU Braunschweig.

## Research Objective

This research aims to develop a novel algorithm for generating synthetic data from combined camera and LiDAR data for 3D object detection. The A2D2 dataset for autonomous driving released by Audi was used as the basis for this contribution. The thesis investigates the feasibility of generating realistic synthetic data by placing foreground objects from one frame into other frames while ensuring no collisions with other objects.
